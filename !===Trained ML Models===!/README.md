These files change regularily and for your neural network to perform the best we know its important that the models are always up to date. We will see if we can actually deliver the latest trained models via our API soon so the models will be delivered over continious ways and can be polled from any service to ensure they are running our latest models.

For now we recommend regularily checking releases on this github repo. If we ever do a big retrain (usually doesnt happen too often) or new neural network there will be a release. For minor versions we try to always update this folder.

Thanks for understanding that we are still aiming to find a better solution for this.

Leechy out!
