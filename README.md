Pamaxie was developed to ensure the security of content on the internet and to verify the security and content of Media uploaded on websites.
This was developed to allow developers of chat applications moderate content automatically. This works either over a neural network detecting safety properties and certain tags inside images or other types of media. The Intention of this connection of Machine Learning and Statically typed algorythms is to create a service that allows the internet to be more secure. Our goal is to make the web more fun and safe to browse and prevent seeing content on websites that you may want to avoid.

We are developig this API with content hosters in mind. We will never share any data or sell it to 3rd parties. We will always treat all user data that we keep on our servers with the highest respect for privacy. This is one of the reasons that we chose to make this an open source project. Our API will be developed to be easy to interact with and stay as responsive as possible with the funding we have at the time.
